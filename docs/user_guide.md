# User guide
Guide on how to use this CHIP-8 emulator.

### Key mapping
The keys are mapped form COSMAC VIP keypad to QWERTY keypad as follows
```
	1 2 3 C           1 2 3 4
	4 5 6 D  ----->   Q W E R
	7 8 9 E  ----->   A S D F
	A 0 B F           Z X C V
```
The keys are mapped via scancode and not via keycode. Keep that in mind if you are using a different keyboard than QWERTY.

### Other controls
- Quit : `Esc`

	Press `Esc` key to quit the program.

- Pause/Unpause 	: `P`
	
	Press `P` to pause or unpause the game.
	
- Change color 	: `L`
	
	Press `L` to get a random color combo. Check color.h to see what colors are available, and maybe you can add some colors of your choice.
