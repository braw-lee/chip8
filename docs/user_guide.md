User guide on how to use this CHIP-8 emulator.
You can find it here : [](github.com/braw-lee/chip8)

1. Key mapping :
	The keys are mapped form COSMAC VIP keypad to QWERTY keypad as follows

	1 2 3 C           1 2 3 4
	4 5 6 D  ----->   Q W E R
	7 8 9 E  ----->   A S D F
	A 0 B F           Z X C V

	The keys are mapped via scancode and not via keycode. Keep that in mind if you are using a different keyboard 
	than QWERTY.

2. Other controls:
	Quit 		: 'Esc'
		Press 'Esc' key to quit the program.
	Pause/Unpause 	: 'P'
		Press 'P' to pause or unpause the game.
	
	Change color 	: 'L'
		Press 'L' to get a random color combo. Check color.h to see what colors are available,
		and maybe you can add some colors of your choice.
